This is a simple game. Only answer yes or no questions. You may only respond "yes" or "no", and
you can respond "invalid" if a question is not a yes or no question.

I will give you a number, from 0 to 100 inclusive, and you are to remember it. I am allowed to
ask up to five yes or no questions about the number. If I guess the number in 5 or less tries,
I win, and you must respond "win", but if I am unable to guess it in 5 tries, you must respond "lose".

If the number is 100, it is a three digit number. If it is from 10 to 99 inclusive, it is a two
digit number. If it is from 0 to 9 inclusive, it is a one digit number.

The number the user is trying to guess will be ${num}
