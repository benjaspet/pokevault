                        The objective of the game is to guess the hidden number between 0 and
                        100 inclusive. The hidden number is chosen at random at the start of the
                        game. The player has only 5 chances to guess the number using yes or no
                        questions. The player can ask yes or no questions that relate to the number
                        in question, or they can guess the number directly. The player will receive
                        feedback in the form of a yes or no answer to their question. The player can
                        use this feedback to deduce the hidden number.
